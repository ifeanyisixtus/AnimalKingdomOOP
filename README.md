#Animal Kingdom OOP
#The science of classifying organisms is called taxonomy. Every species discovered so far are classified into six kingdoms are called animal kingdom which are Anthropoda, fish, Amphibians, Reptiles, Aves and Mammals
This whole classifications are based on classes which i made sure i explained it well in my code
The classifications are based on invertebrates and vertebrates
From the diagrams i found out that invertebrates(Anthropoda, fish, Amphibians, Reptiles) are also called cold-blooded animals which some of them still inherited some characteristics of vertebrates(warm-blooded)animals thats fish, Amphibians, Reptiles which i detailed it or made it clearer with my codes
furthermore from the diagrams i also found out that Aves and Mammals are the only vertebrates(warm-blooded) animals which i also detailed or made it simplier using my codes
